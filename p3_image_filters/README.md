# ðŸ“¸ Image Processing with Linear Algebra

This project contains a Python script (`image_transformations.py`) that demonstrates how matrix transformations can be used to create image filters.

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Script

### 1. Install Libraries
Open your terminal and run the following command to install the required packages:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib Pillow
```

### 2. **Choose an Image**
Look inside the `materials` folder and choose an image you want to use (e.g., `image.jpg`, `daylilies.jpg`, etc.). **You must edit the Python script to use your chosen image.**

### 3. Execute the Script
Navigate into this project's folder and run the script:
```bash
cd p3_image_filters
python image_transformations.py
```
The script will load the image you specified from the `materials` folder and display the results.

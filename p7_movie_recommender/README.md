# ðŸŽ¬ Project 7: Movie Recommender System

This project contains a Python script (`movie_recommender.py`) that builds a simple content-based recommendation system. It suggests movies to a user by finding existing users with the most similar tastes.

The similarity between users is measured using two different metrics from linear algebra: **Euclidean Distance** and **Pearson Correlation**.

## ðŸ”¬ The Core Concepts

A user's taste can be represented as a **vector** in a high-dimensional space, where each dimension corresponds to their rating for a specific movie. To find users with similar tastes, we need to measure how "close" their vectors are.

### 1. Euclidean Distance
This is the straight-line distance between two vectors. A smaller distance means the users have more similar ratings across the board. If `u` is our user's rating vector and `v` is another user's vector, the distance is:
$$
d(u, v) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (u_i - v_i)^2}
$$
**Limitation**: This metric is sensitive to differences in rating scales. For example, a user who rates everything between 3-5 will seem very distant from a user who rates everything 1-3, even if their preferences are structurally similar.

### 2. Pearson Correlation
This metric measures the **linear relationship** between two vectors. It first centers the data by subtracting the mean rating from each user's vector, making it insensitive to different rating scales. A correlation coefficient near **+1** means the users have very similar tastes (they tend to rate movies similarly relative to their own average), while a value near **-1** means they have opposite tastes.
$$
\rho(u, v) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (u_i - \bar{u})(v_i - \bar{v})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (u_i - \bar{u})^2} \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (v_i - \bar{v})^2}}
$$
**Advantage**: Pearson correlation is often better for recommendation systems because it captures the *pattern* of ratings, not just their absolute values.

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Script

### 1. Prerequisites
You need Python and the `numpy` and `scipy` libraries.

### 2. Install Libraries
If you don't have them, open your terminal and run:
```bash
pip install numpy scipy
```

### 3. Data Files
1.  Make sure you have a folder named `materials`
2.  Use the `users_movies.mat` file inside this `materials` folder.

The file structure should look like this:
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ p7_movie_recommender/   
    â””â”€â”€ movie_recommender.py
â””â”€â”€ materials/
    â””â”€â”€ users_movies.mat
```

### 4. Execute the Script
Run the script from your terminal:
```bash
python movie_recommender.py
```
The script will first analyze the provided `trial_user` and then run the same analysis for the custom `myratings` vector defined inside the script. You can edit the `myratings` vector to get personalized recommendations!
